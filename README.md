# automata
Code related to the wonderful world of cellular automata. One dimensional cellular automata script is complete. Although, it would be 
better with a prettier image output. Next job is to write a script which produces "Conway's Game of Life" and other 2D cellular automata. 

Unfortunately GLaDOS has infected one of my scripts. If she promises you cake, do not believe her.
