# automata
Code related to the wonderful world of cellular automata.

(1) cellularautomata.py is my first attempt. This script prints in the terminal.
(2) onedimCA_print.py uses matplotlib to output a nicer picture. Allowing for finer resolution.
    Also this second script has two different evolution functions pertaining to different choices for the off-end cells:
       (i) I think it is convention to set the off-end cells to 'alive' i.e. 1. First function does this.
       (ii) But the second function sets the off-end cell equal to the last cell at the opposite end i.e. wraps grid into a cylinder.

Next job is to write a script which produces "Conway's Game of Life" and other 2D cellular automata. 

Unfortunately GLaDOS has infected one of my scripts. If she promises you cake, do not believe her.
